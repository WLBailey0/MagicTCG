********** MAGIC THE GATHERING PROJECTS **********

This repo is for Magic The Gathering projects. These projects were made by me or as a collaboration with friends. All code is open and avalible to use. If you choose to use or modify any of these projects I just ask that you give partial credit. 

**************************************************

For the android app I have some tasks I would like to complete. The basic counting part is made, Now I need a user name and password that that will be stored in a database. Users will be able to find other users that they are playing with. The other users life total will be displayed on your screen. This solves a problem I have where I don't want to touch someone elses phone and I would for them not to touch mine.

**************************************************

If you would like to collaborate just send me an email at wlbailey0@gmail.com and I'll be happy to work with you.
